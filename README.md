## Features

- **Native Persistence**: Implements a custom "Handoff & Sync" protocol ensuring 100% save-state integrity across app restarts.
- **Quick Save & Load**: The **only** PICO-8 experience with instant save states. Freeze time and resume anywhere, across devices.

## Under the Hood: A Rant

The core engineering challenge was **reconciling the asynchronous nature of iOS file I/O with the synchronous requirements of the Emscripten/WASM virtual file system.**

PICO-8 demands a synchronous file system. Bridging this to iOS required completely reverse-engineering the Emscripten boot sequence.

- **Bootloader Hijacking:** The engine defaults to booting the standard "JELPI" demo cart. To bypass this, I had to intercept the `Module.preRun` lifecycle, manually injecting user code into the WASM heap and forcing the pointer to the correct entry point before the runtime could initialize.
- **True State Persistence:** I architected a system that dumps the _entire simulated RAM_ into a serialized blob. I implemented **GZIP** compression to keep these memory snapshots lightweight, allowing for atomic, instant state restoration.

It’s _not_ a browser wrapper; it’s a custom runtime environment built for native iOS, enjoy the speeds!

2. Sideload via **AltStore**, **SideStore**, or **Sideloadly**.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** in iOS Settings (Settings > General > Device Management > Your Name).

## Project Status

This is a solo dev project designed to bring the PICO-8 communnity a beautiful native app for iPhones and iPads. I'm aiming to submit this to the AppStore as soon as possible, after all the positive support! Check back soon (:
### build from source
```bash
npm install && npx cap sync && npx cap open ios
```

## How to Get Games

### v1.4+

Use the BBS Browser by clicking the globe icon at the top. This lets you search lexaloffle's games in-app!

### Manually:

Pocket8 uses standard PICO-8 cartridges (`.p8` or `.p8.png`).

1.  **Visit the BBS**: Go to [lexaloffle.com/bbs](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/) or [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/tag-pico-8).
2.  **Look for the Cart**: You need the **cartridge file**, not a zip or exe. Look for the little square image that looks like the game cover.
3.  **Save It**:
    - **Desktop**: Right-click the small "Cart" icon -> "Save Image As".
    - **iOS**: Tap and hold the cart image -> "Save to Files".
4.  **Import**: In Pocket8, tap the `+` icon and select your saved `.p8.png` file.
